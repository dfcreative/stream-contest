Compare streams vs pull-streams vs function chain.

Setup is source + mapper + destination, pressure is controlled by realtime output, we measure time it takes from getting signal of hunger till processing is done, average per audio frame of 1024 samples (23.2ms of audio).

### Results

| Handler | Latrecy per 1024 sample frame (23.2ms) | Overhead |
|---|---|---|
| Function | .5ms | 0% |
| [pull-stream](https://github.com/pull-stream/pull-stream) | .7ms | 0.8% |
| [streams](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html) | .85ms | 1.5% |
| [audio-through](https://github.com/audiojs/audio-through) | 1ms | 2.1% |

### Latencies [ยน](#reference)

| Type | Latency |
|---|---|
| Minimal noticeable latency of a person hearing his voice | 15ms |
| Minimal noticeable latency of a person not hearing his voice | 20-30ms |
| Comfortable communication latency | < 200ms |
| Radio Broadcast | 10ms is the best, 100+ms is real |
| Telephone calls | 100-200ms |
| IP calls | 20-150ms |
| Internet radio | 200ms+ |
| Live performance | 3ms per 1m of air |
| DSP filters | .5ms - 15ms |
| ASIO drivers | 8ms |
